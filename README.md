# Overview

This is a simple cloud database program. It allows the user to store/manipulate employee data, including a name, home state, and experience, as well as position data, which includes a work position title, a manager name, and an amount of pay for the position. This is stored in the cloud via Google Firebase and can be accessed and updated from multiple locations simultaneously.<br><br>
All information is stored [here.](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/employee-database-c9b7c/firestore/data~2F) You might not be able to access that. I'm not sure.
